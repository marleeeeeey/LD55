# Hungry Portals (LD55 Game)

**Hungry Portals** - is a platformer game developed for the [Ludum Dare 55 game jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55/ld55-hungry-portals).

Hungry Portals from the dark realm are out for blood, and theyâ€™ve turned their attention to your home, trapping your demonic family within their shadowy depths. You start as a lone survivor with a chance to save your kin and reclaim your home. [More details...](docs/GAME_DESCRIPTION.md)

### Development Guidelines

#### Efficient Component Access (Entt)

- **Use of Views**: When you need to iterate over entities that share a common set of components, prefer using `view` over `all_of` or `any_of` checks within loop iterations. Views are optimized for fast access and iteration, as they precompute and cache the entities that match the specified component criteria. This approach significantly reduces overhead and improves performance, especially with large entity sets.

```cpp
  // Recommended
  auto view = registry.view<ComponentA, ComponentB>();
  for (auto entity : view) {
      // Process entities that have both ComponentA and ComponentB
  }
  ```

- **Avoid Frequent Component Checks**: Using `registry.all_of` or `registry.any_of` in tight loops for large numbers of entities can be inefficient. These functions check each entity's component makeup at runtime, which can lead to performance degradation if used improperly. (TODO2: check the game code for this).

```cpp
  // Not recommended for large sets or frequent updates
  for (auto entity : registry) {
      if (registry.all_of<ComponentA, ComponentB>(entity)) {
          // Process entity
      }
  }
  ```

- **Entity Processing Recommendations**: If specific conditional checks on entity components are necessary outside of views, consider structuring your logic to minimize the frequency and scope of these checks, or use architectural patterns that naturally segregate entities into manageable sets. (TODO2: thinking about splitting entities into more specific components).

#### Object Factory

- **ObjectsFactory** is the only object that should add new components to the `entt::registry`.
  - Any method that creates a new object must start with `Spawn`.

#### Component Naming Conventions

- Class names for components must end with `Component`.
  - Header files containing components should end with `_components.h`.

#### Coordinate Systems and Object Sizing

- Texture sizes are measured in pixels, while the sizes of objects in the physical world are measured in meters.
- There are three coordinate systems: screen, pixel world, and physical world. Variable names should end with `Screen`, `World` (TODO3: rename to `Pixels`), or `Physics`.

#### C++ Style Guide

- Prefer using `enum class` over boolean variables.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Use descriptive and clear naming conventions that reflect the purpose and usage of the variable or function.

#### Configuration Style Guide

- In `config.json`, section names should correspond to the class names that use them.
- Variable naming in `config.json` should be a direct copy of the variable names in the code.

#### Animation Editor and Engine Integration

- The player animation stores the BBox (bounding box) of the object used for collision detection.
- Bullet animations should not consider the dimensions of the BBox for speed calculations.

### Assets Editing Guidelines

#### Aseprite Guidelines

- **Tagging**: Ensure that all frames are tagged, as these tags are referenced in the C++ code for animation handling.
- **Hitbox Frame**: Include a specifically named frame `Hitbox` within your Aseprite files, which will be used to define interaction boundaries in the game.

#### Tiled Map Editor Guidelines

- **Layer Structure**: Your maps should be organized with the following layers from bottom to top:
  - `background`: For non-interactive scenery that appears behind all game entities.
  - `interiors`: For elements like indoor furnishings that players can potentially interact with but are not part of the terrain.
  - `terrain`: For the main walkable and interactive layer of the game environment.
  - `objects`: For movable or interactive objects that players can interact with during the game.

## Windows build

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/marleeeeeey/LD55-game.git
```

### Prerequisites for Building the Project (Windows)

- CMake.
- Ninja.
- Clang compiler (other compilers may work, but are not officially supported).
- Git (to load submodules).
- Visual Studio Code (recommended for development).
  - Clangd extension (recommended for code analysis).
- Python and 7zip (for packaging game to achive).

### Build, run and debug via VSCode tasks (Windows)

- Open the project folder in VSCode.
- Run task: `003. (Win) Install vcpkg as subfolder`.
- Run task: `050. (WinDebug) + Run`.
- For debugging press `F5`.

### Build, run and debug manually (Windows)

To build LD55 on Windows, it's recommended to obtain the dependencies by using vcpkg. The following instructions assume that you will follow the vcpkg recommendations and install vcpkg as a subfolder. If you want to use "classic mode" or install vcpkg somewhere else, you're on your own.

This project define it's dependences:
1. In a `vcpkg.json` file, and you are pulling in vcpkg's cmake toolchain file.
2. As git submodules in the `thirdparty` directory. Because some of the libraries not available in vcpkg or have an error in the vcpkg port file.

First, we bootstrap a project-specific installation of vcpkg ("manifest mode") in the default location, `<project root>/vcpkg`. From the project root, run these commands:

```
cd LD55-game
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

Now we ask vcpkg to install of the dependencies for our project, which are described by the file `<project root>/vcpkg.json`.  Note that this step is optional, as cmake will automatically do this.  But here we are doing it in a separate step so that we can isolate any problems, because if problems happen here don't have anything to do with your cmake files.

```
.\vcpkg\vcpkg install --triplet=x64-windows
```

Next build the project files. There are different options for
1. Telling cmake how to integrate with vcpkg: here we use `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` on the command line.
2. Select Ninja project generator.
3. Select Clang compiler.
4. Enable `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` to generate a `compile_commands.json` file for clangd.

```
cmake -S . -B build -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
cd build
cmake --build .
```

Finally, we copy the assets and configuration file to the build directory.

```
cmake -E copy ../config.json ./src/config.json
cmake -E copy_directory ../assets ./src/assets
```

Run the game:

```
src\LD55.exe
```

## Linux build

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/marleeeeeey/LD55-game.git
```

### Prerequisites for Building the Project (Linux)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install python3 clang ninja-build curl zip unzip tar autoconf automake libtool python3-pip cmake
pip install jinja2
```

### Build, run and debug via VSCode tasks (Linux)

- Open the project folder in VSCode.
- Run task: `103. (Lin) Install vcpkg as subfolder`.
- Run task: `150. (LinDebug) + Run`.
- For debugging press `F5`. (TODO3 Implement it later).

### Build, run and debug manually (Linux)

```bash
cd LD55-game
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg && ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh && ./vcpkg/vcpkg install --triplet=x64-linux
cmake -S . -B build -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
cmake --build build/debug -- -k 0
cmake -E copy config.json build/debug/src/config.json
cmake -E copy_directory assets build/debug/src/assets
./build/debug/src/LD55
```
