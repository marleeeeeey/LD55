### Gameplay Overview

**Hungry portals** from the dark realm are out for blood, and they've turned their attention to your home, trapping your demonic family within their shadowy depths. You start as a lone survivor with a chance to save your kin and reclaim your home.

#### Objective:

### Game Mechanics:

- **Portal Dynamics:** Portals that collide with each other disperse chaotically. Stay alert!
- **Building on the Fly:** Construct small platforms to navigate and trap portals.
- **Feeding the Portals:** Without sufficient debris to consume, portals will hunt you down.

### Strategy Tips:

- **Adapt Your Arsenal:** Use the right tools for the right obstacles. Switch between weapons to maximize destruction.
- **Resource Management:** Building materials are infinite. Use them to create platforms and move around the map.
- **Stay Mobile:** Keep moving to avoid being overwhelmed by the portals' influence.
